## Read 10

- The only reading for today is JavaScript reading. This reading is talks about debugging. The first part of reading is all about understanding where your error is. To do this you must know the scope of your document. This is the whay that JavaScript is executing the flow of information that you put in. There are multiply types of errors that are given: styntax errors, Reference Errors, Eval Errors, URI errors, Type Errors, Range Errors, NaN. You need to know what type of error you are looking at and then were to go to fix that error. The console is a good place to help you. In your console you will get the error and the line that the error is on. Using Console.log will also assist if you want to see what part of the code is working you can log that into the console. The Debug Keywork can also help you. This is a breakpoint in the code to help you with your debug. Having steps that you follow to find issues and debug is a good practice. I personlally strip my code back by commenting sections out and console logging to see if that section is running properly.
