- This reading is all about what good teams are and what good teams do. Google did research on teams and what makes a good team. They came up with a lot of different data cominalities and personalities. How well people on a team get along, what their intrests are. All of this is good and well but what they came up with is to make sure everyone has a voice. Not just a voice but their voice and that they feel comfortable in sharing their voice. The biggest thing is making people in the team feel comfortable and like they matter. This is the biggest thing for team success. To me this is just being a good person. Be open to others and leave your ego at the door when you are dealing with teams to create projects.
