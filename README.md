## Read 02
- Read number 02 for the HTML gives more infomation on the different attibutes to use when coding in HTML. This Chapter pages 40 through 61 is going to be a great resource to refference when wanting to know different attributes to do different things when using HTML. I will be referancing this chapter when coding different items in my HTML. The other HTML and CSS reading was an introduction to CSS. In this section it gives an introduction to CSS and what selectors, declarations and values are. How to write CSS code and the different ways of doing that are also in this section. This section explains using external CSS versus internal. It does not talk about inline CSS. 

- Read 02 for the JavaScript talks about basic JavaScript commands such as variables and Strings. It goes on to talk about using these to create things such as arrays, then using the arrays to create strings and have string opperators in order to put things together. The second read in the JavaScript talks about logic and using logic to compare things. It talks about Boolean language and logic, how we can use these locical statments in code to compare and output different variables in our site. This read also gives an introduction into if statments in if else statements. Again this will help us compare and output different things in our javaScript.

## Read 03

- The First HTML reading is all about lists. This reading talks about everything that you can do with lists including order, unordered, definition, and nested. The secont HTML reading is all about the box Mode. This is padding, border, and margin. This box Model helps organize HTML text by spacing and giving specific hieght width and color. Using HTML and CSS together to adjust size, color, shape of boxes can give the website a professional feel.

- The JavaScript reading talks about if else statements. These statements will run one set of code for true statements and a seperate set of code for false statements. Using loops will help you repeate set of statements. You must give the loop paramaters in order to tell it when to start and when to stop.
