## Read 6

- There is only JavaScript reading for this read. The first JavaScript reading is over object liters. This is when you can add a literal notion to your object by using a dot. For example if my object is hotel and the name of the hotel is what i want I can use an opbject literal to get that hotel.name. The second JavaScript Reaing is over document object model. The document object model or (DOM), specifies how the browsers should create a modle of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of the page while it is in the browswer window (pg 184). We can use this by using getElementById('element selected'). We can also use things like querySelector, getElementByClassName, getElementByTagName. The reading also talks about parents and childeren of parents and how that is used in teh DOM. We can also insert things by using .innerHTML with the DOM. We can also creat things and append them to already created parents by using document.createElement and .appendChild.
Using the removeEl will remove things. Finally the reading talks about examing the DOM using your browsers developer tools.
